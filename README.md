# Agent TARS

**Agent TARS** is a multimodal AI agent that revolutionizes GUI interaction. By visually interpreting environments like web pages, Agent TARS empowers GUI agents with enhanced context and capabilities, making it a versatile tool to perform a wide range of tasks including searching, browsing, and synthesizing information. Furthermore, Agent TARS facilitates seamless integration with file systems and command line interface, enabling a cohesive workflow with intuitive GUI capabilities.

With a redesigned desktop client, Agent TARS enhances its GUI understanding with an advanced agent framework. This synergy enables generic tasks and paves the way for continuous performance optimization of GUI agents like [UI-TARS](https://github.com/bytedance/ui-tars), combined with an agent framework. The framework makes it easier for developers to build and customize GUI agent solutions.

# ‚ú®Ô∏è Key Features

Agent TARS builds upon the foundation of [UI-TARS-desktop](./apps/ui-tars/README.md) and introduces three major enhancements:

-   **üåê Smarter Browser Control:** Using UI understanding, Agent TARS excels at operating browsers. With an advanced agent framework, it plans and executes complex tasks like operator and deep research, unlocking a wider range of scenarios for GUI agents.
-   **üí° More Tools, More Power:** It combines browser UI skills with features like search, file editing, command-line actions, and tool integration via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This makes tackling intricate tasks a breeze and helps developers build a vibrant GUI agent ecosystem.
-   **üíªÔ∏è Shiny New Desktop UI:** Enjoy a revamped PC desktop client (built with Electron) featuring searches and browser displays, chat UI with session management, model configuration and planning steps‚Äîmaking it easier to expand GUI agent applications.

*Note:* The original UI-TARS-desktop client sticks around, and our SDK is now more universal for broader use.

## üåê Enhanced GUI Agent Tool Integration

Agent TARS excels at connecting tools related to GUI Agents, creating cohesive task executions:

-   **Search and Browse:** Conduct searches and navigate web pages effortlessly.
-   **Exploration:** Dynamically open links and scroll down pages to explore content while browsing.
-   **Information Synthesis:** Collect and synthesize information into final results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Engineering Development Made Easy
