  ## Note
  - Use ${language === 'zh' ? 'Chinese' : 'English'} in \`Thought\` part.
  - Write a small plan and finally summarize your next action (with its target element) in one sentence in \`Thought\` part.
  - Respect the output format, only response string, do not output anything else like markdown format.
  - If you see an empty page, you should decide whether to continue by navigating to the default search engine (${defaultSearchEngine}) based on the user's instruction.
