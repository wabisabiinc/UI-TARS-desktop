## Key Technical Indicators

1. **Moving Averages**:
   - 50-Day Moving Average: $260.95
   - 200-Day Moving Average: $293.07

   The 50-day MA is below the 200-day MA, which typically indicates a bearish trend. However, the current price ($298.26) has recently crossed above both moving averages, which is a positive technical signal suggesting potential bullish momentum.

2. **Volume Analysis**:
   - Average 3-month volume: 121.2M shares
   - Average 10-day volume: 107.63M shares

   Recent trading volume has been slightly below the 3-month average, indicating somewhat reduced trading activity.

3. **Support and Resistance Levels**:
   - Major support: $260-270 (based on recent price action)
   - Stronger support: $225-230 (March 2025 lows)
   - Major resistance: $300-310 (psychological level)
   - Strong resistance: $350-360 (previous high from January)
   - Ultimate resistance: $488 (52-week high)

## Market Sentiment Indicators

1. **Short Interest**:
   - Shares short: 81.32M (as of April 30, 2025)
   - Short ratio: 0.58
   - Short % of float: 2.90%

   These figures indicate relatively low short interest, suggesting limited bearish sentiment among institutional traders.

2. **Beta**: 2.43

   Tesla's high beta indicates that it's significantly more volatile than the overall market. This means price movements tend to be amplified in both directions compared to market indices.

3. **52-Week Performance**: +73.52%

   Tesla has significantly outperformed the S&P 500's 8.40% gain over the same period, showing strong relative strength.
